Subject: [PATCH] pyscard: drop swig from pyproject build-system requires

Avoid requiring a Python distribution named "swig" during PEP 517
dependency resolution. Buildroot provides the SWIG binary as a host tool
(`host-swig`), and setup.py already checks for and uses the executable.

Upstream pyproject.toml:
  [build-system]
  requires = ["setuptools","swig"]

Change to only require setuptools so builds work offline with Buildroot.
